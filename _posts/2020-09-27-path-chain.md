`path.chain` package provides an intuitive and easy-to-use system of
nested objects, which represents different levels of some directory’s
structure in the file system. It allows us to

Look at the `path.chain`
------------------------

Sometimes one picture can say more, than a thousand words, and this is
exactly the case.

Motivation
----------

I’ve been working on the ML project, when we decided to keep strcture of
the input data in the **YAML** config. The structure were getting
complicated, and at some point on this history ou config get a form like
this:

``` yaml
default:
  kData:
    kRoot: 'our/super/dir'
    kTerroir:
      kRoot: 'terroir'
      kSoils: 'soils.fst'
      kTemperature: 'temperature.fst'
      kRains: 'rains.fst'
    kWineQuality:
      kChemicalParams: 'chemical_params.fst'
      kContestResults: 'contest_results.fst'
```

For your infomation: the example above is totally fictitious and has
nothing to do with the actual project I’ve been woking on. Moreover, in
our project, several times more of paths were defined. As you can
imagine, such structure forced us to load data in the following manner:

``` r
config <- config::get(
  config = "default"
  file = "path/to/config",
  use_parent = FALSE  
)

path <- file.path(
  config$kData$kRoot,
  config$kData$kTerroir$kRoot,
  config$kData$kTerroir$kSoils
)

vineyard_soils <- fst::read_fst(path)
```

Doesn’t it look redundant? So, I’ve written a `path.chain` package:
using it we can perform the same action with less code:

``` r
library(path.chain)

vineyard_soils <- fst::read_fst(
  config$kData$kTerroir$kSoils
)
```

Isn’t it nice for your eyes?

If I would like to modify the config, say, with the following change,

``` yaml
default:
  kData:
    kRoot: 'our/super/dir'
    kTerroir:
      kRoot: 'terroir'
      kSoils: 'vineyard_soils.fst' # <- This is the change
      kTemperature: 'temperature.fst'
      kRains: 'rains.fst'
    kWineQuality:
      kChemicalParams: 'chemical_params.fst'
      kContestResults: 'contest_results.fst'
```

the code is still working.

What if we would like to reconfigure our list of paths wthout changing
the code? It may probably break desired behaviour of our scripts, but
with `path.chain` we can easily detect the cause looking into logs.
Simply use `on_path_not_exists` or `on_validate_path`

``` r
on_validate_path(
  ~ if(tools::file_ext(.x) == '.fst') print("Invalid file")
)

on_path_not_exists(~ log_error("Path {.x} not exists"))
```

documentation](https://krzjoa.github.io/path.chain/index.html).
