Recently, a new exciting R package was submitted on CRAN. This great news was officially announced on the RStudio AI Blog. Yes, you mean right - the R port of PyTorch - called simply torch came into play. This encouraged me to reactivate my series, but in this time with both R and Pythonic versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
